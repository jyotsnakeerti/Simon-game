# Simon-game
Here's how the Simon game typically works:
1. Press any key to start the game
2. The game starts with a simple sequence where one color is highlighted and a sound is played.
3. Repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding colors or buttons in the correct order.
4. After successfully repeating the sequence, the game adds one more step to the pattern, making it longer and more challenging.
5. The game continues to increase the pattern length with each successful round.
6. If the player makes a mistake and repeats the sequence incorrectly, the game typically plays a "wrong" sound and Game gets over!
7. Press any Key again to restart the game
